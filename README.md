Module 8 Submission for Projects in CS-320


The relevant files for grading in this repository are the .java files and the Project2 .docx file.

Addressing the following:

    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    How do I approach designing software?

The ensurance of anything in the software world requires testing. After all, how can we be certain of something we cannot prove? Functionality can be straightforward, as it is the main goal of the software to begin with, whereas security can be more difficult, as threats are ever-changing. Both can be tested using simple principles: an assertion that the code should withstand some assessment, the creation of such an assessment, and the execution of the code under this assessment. This forms the basis of testing software.

Interpreting user needs into software also follows a similar pattern: determine what user needs may be, assert that the code adheres to these needs, assess the code, and validate that this code has actually incorporated the needs of a user. Repeat and modify as necessary. Making sure your software fulfills a purpose is the most important part of development. Code is only good if it is going to be executed.

My personal approach to designing software is to first create a list of goals(features) for my program. I organize them into categories and make indented bullet points below them on how these goals might be implemented. Once I've a rough design, I start working on some components of the program to see where my design may need adjustment and how these components will need to integrate to one another. In my own projects, I tend to develop tests after the program is in some working state, but I can definitely see the advantages gained from developing tests beforehand as a means of assessing whether the code has really reached "some working state" in the first place.
